Comparing Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Training Chess Engines through Self-Play

Value functions are used in modern chess engines to accelerate and improve tree search methods. 
This repository compares different learning algorithms in the training of such value functions through self-play. 
Results from different approaches are validated against each other and against the stockfish engine.
